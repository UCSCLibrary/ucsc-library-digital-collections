# UCSC Library Digital Collections Repository

This Rails application is based on the Hyrax gem as part of the Samvera project. With Solr and Fedora it is meant to be used as a repository and access point for some of UCSC's digital collections. 
A basic Hyrax installation has been customized with our own metadata schema, styling, and some features that are specific to our instutition. We have developed our own batch ingest widget, and we integrate our samvera-hls gem for audiovisual transcoding and streaming. 

This project is under heavy development.
